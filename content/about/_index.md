![James A. Gibson](/JG2021.jpg)

I am a technical lead software engineer working in the healthcare space. My work spans the entire software development lifecycle, from design to implementation, testing, and deployment. 
In a previous career I worked in philosophy specializing in metaphysics and epistemology, especially on free will, and philosophy of religion. I also spent a good amount of time in the history of philosophy and some history of philosophy of science. I am very much a generalist.

I reside in Coronado, CA with my family.
