This page will document some of the literature I have found to be useful for learning the business, marketing, and management side of creating a startup. Engineers who want to start their own businesses should take useful steps to educate themselves on these matters before attempting to acquire a bunch of money only to lose it all. My sense is that companies that hire engineers will go either two routes: either engineers will become cogs in a machine confined to very specific tasks or they will be required to know more about the business side. The former is likely the case for junior engineers in larger companies but the latter likely will be required for more senior engineers and leads of smaller companies. 

I will update the list as I can. If there is a work I should add to this list, please send me an email. 

#### *The Founder's Dilemmas: Anticipating and Avoiding the Pitfalls That Can Sink a Startup*. Noam Wasserman. Princeton University Press, 2012.

[Noam Wasserman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_T._Wasserman)'s book was the number one top bestseller on Amazon in management. The data presented in this book is based on surveys conducted between 2000-2009,  which includes 9,900 founders, 19k executive, and 3607 startups. The book highlights a series of tradeoffs that entrepreneurs must make when deciding when and how to create a startup. The main dilemma that is at the core is the choice between being Rich or being King. The book follows numerous real world "serial" entrepreneurs such as Evan Williams (Twitter / Blogger / Medium) and traces the sort of trade offs these individuals had to make based on different circumstances. I found the discussions of how founders might think about equity splits, how roles can be divided, and what sort of characteristics matter for executives to be insightful as someone who had not worked on that side of the business before. 

#### *The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses.* Eric Ries. Crown, 2011.
