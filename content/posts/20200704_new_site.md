2020 has seen a worldwide pandemic, massive earthquakes, UFOs, murder hornets, a massive wave of unemployment, riots, the complete failure of local and federal governments, rings of pedophiles even among the culture's most celebrated, and now for better or for worse, I am back. It's just what 2020 needed (_wink_,_wink_). I am trying out a new framework for a website. I used Wordpress before mostly because of how simple it was. However, I felt as if it were too slow; too many plug-ins, dependence on a database, features in the CMS about which I do not care. I wanted something more simple more akin to how I like to build sites, and so I chose Hugo. 

Hugo is a static website generator written in Go that is fairly new. The cool thing is you can write your files with markup language. Since it is a static site, there is no need for a DB.

I do not intend this to be a running blog, but more of a temporary place to provide updates what I am thinking about or working on. The main place to find my settled thoughts is in the Papers section. More defeasibly held thoughts are in the Posts. And complete madness can be found in my Twitter feed. For anything otherwise unclear feel free to email me.
