Philosophy of Religion
------------------------
- [Anselm on Freedom and Grace]( {{< baseurl >}}data/anselm_on_freedom_and_grace.pdf ), _Oxford Studies in Philosophy of Religion_, vol. 5 (2014)
    > The chapter presents Anselm’s incompatibilist account of human freedom within the context of his theodicy and presents two arguments against his account. Both arguments aim to show there is a genuine conflict between his account of freedom and the role of God’s grace in making agents just. The first argument, the problem of harmonization, highlights the conflict within the soteriological context where an agent changes from being unjust to being just. The second argument, the problem of just creation, highlights the conflict within the context of the creation of agents prior to the presence of evil. Holding fixed his incompatibilist account and the necessity of divine grace, the upshot of both arguments is that Anselm must endorse a version of Pelagianism. 

Theology

- [For God so Loved the World]({{< baseurl >}}data/jn316a_jagibson.pdf) _draft_ (2020) (Comments welcomed.)
    > This article examines John 3:16 in the context of the debate about the extent of God's salvific love. It argues that more attention should be given to the first part about God's love for the world rather than "whosoever believes". After identifying the main interpretive contenders, it proposes a hermeneutic based in empathetic understanding to determine which interpretation is the most plausible. On that basis, a positive interpretation is provided resulting in a variant of one of the main interpretative contenders, according to which none of our categories of exclusion prohibit God from extending his grace to any person. An implication of this *unrestricted-categorical interpretation* is that John 3:16 remains an evangelistic passage, which is illustrated through addressing the racial and political challenges during the 2020 pandemic.
